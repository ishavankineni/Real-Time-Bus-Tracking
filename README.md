# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking

This exercise intends to render, build and manipulate maps on web pages. This project uses 'mapbox' which is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page.

**TO RUN THIS:**
Use index.html to render the program over any web browser.

**Roadmap of future improvements:** This program can be improved by adding API's that respond with locations between any given points, which would enable the user to check the stops between any points. This can be made into a fullstack project that can be leveraged for real time tracking scenarios, where we use the current location of the user to do the further processing.
